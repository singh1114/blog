_**About the Entry task**_

A entry task was Â given to me in which I have to take some values from the user like :



	
  * Length of the table

	
  * Breadth of the table

	
  * Thickness of the table

	
  * Height of the Legs

	
  * Width of the legs

	
  * Thickness of the legs


and I have to show these on webpage :

	
  * Side View

	
  * Front View

	
  * Top View

	
  * Bottom View


by using JavaScript. Page was made with the help of HTML. Styling is done with the help of CSS.
